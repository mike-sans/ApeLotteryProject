This is a lottery contract in which players buy as many tickets as they want, each for an entrance fee, to have a shot at winning the whole pool. An admin will choose when the lottery is opened. Utilizes a self-designed commit and reveal mechanism with defined time limits for those phases for the sake of a strong and secure (for a pseudo-random at least) pseudo-random winner selection. This mechanism implements staking to make collusion unprofitable, and other features to be specified. Has the limitation of requiring that the stake to entrance fee ratio is greater than the allowed number of players in the lottery.
